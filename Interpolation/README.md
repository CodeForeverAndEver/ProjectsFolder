### Interpolation

In the context of this explanation, we can define interpolation as:
> The determination of *f(x)*, given two points, (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) and (x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>), on the function, *f*, where x<sub>1</sub> < x < x<sub>2</sub>

In coding, when we are writing a function for interpolation, we say that the x-values of the two points are *0* and *1*, respectively. Since we are dealing with interpolation, the x-value ranges between *0* and *1*. If we were extrapolating, the x-value would be less than *0* or greater than *1*.

### Linear Interpolation
Linear interpolation is interpolation where the y-value returned from the given x-value is co**linear** (on the same line) as the two outer points.

Now, if you think about an equation of a line, it takes in an x-value and gets the corresponding y-value for that specific x-value. If you consider all possible x-values, their corresponding points (given by that equation) reside on the same line.

An equation that takes in an x-value and returns a y-value which is colinear with other points generated by the same equation is just what linear interpolation is! We can use the equation of a line to get the linear interpolation function!

Here I'll calculate it using the slope-intercept form, but any equation that generates a line could give the same result. All that the slope-intercept equation needs is the slope of the line, which we can calculate with two points (which we have!), and the y-intercept, which we can also easily calculate, shown below.

From this, we can make the following function:

```py
def linearInterpolate(y1, y2, mu):
  return (y2 - y1) * mu + y1
```
where `mu` is the *x-value* that you would like to calculate Since we are interpolating, `mu` has to range between *0* and *1* (the x-values of the y-values given - remember from the [definition section above](https://gist.github.com/CodeForeverAndEver/1199da0c95367f8dc2bdf3b16d1fc2ec#interpolation) that we say that the x-values of the two points are *0* and *1*, respectively).

The linear interpolation function looks like the following:

Now you can see how, taking in 2 y-values and an x-value we can get the resulting y-value. This function will give us the basis for all future interpolation functions.

### Cosine Interpolation
```py
import math

def cosineInterpolate(y1, y2, mu):
  angle = mu * math.pi 
  mu2 = (1.0f - cos(angle)) * 0.5f # get new x-value based on cosine function
  return linearInterpolate(y1, y2, mu2)
```

This is common for making the interpolation look **smoother**. 

To understand what is happening here, consider these steps:
1. a radian angle, `angle`, is calculated based on the original argument, `mu`, representing the x-value.
2. The `cosine` of that angle is calculated. 
3. Because the linear interpolation function takes x-values from 0 to 1 and cosine can range from -1 to 1, we subtract the result from 1 to get the range of 0 to 2. Then we half that so the range is 0 to 1.

If you look at this [Desmos graph](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/b0b9eltiw9), you can see how the cosine allows for stable input to the linear interpolation function for values close to 0 or 1, but also provides steeper input for the linear interpolation functions for values farther from 0 or 1.

This results in a nice, smooth interpolation:
